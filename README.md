# Dijsktra-cpp-implementation

This repo contains cpp implementation of Dijskta's shortest path algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)	 

The system requires an input file which contains the grid it needs to parse. For this example, we have taken a file input.txt which contains the following grid

##.##.#
#..##.#
#.#####
#..####
#######

here # is for forbidden places and . for allowed places.
